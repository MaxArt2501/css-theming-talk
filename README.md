CSS Theming talk
================

Slides for a talk about CSS Theming. # slides, about 40 minutes.

Originally conceived for the [2018 CSS Day](http://2018.cssday.it/talks.html#massimo-artizzu) in Faenza, 2018-03-16.

Built on top of [Spectacle](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle), PostCSS, Gulp.

## Building

Node.js 8.x is required (actually it could work in Node 6 - haven't checked). Also this presentation has been
developed and tested in Chrome only.

1. Clone the repository (it weighs 24 MB with images and all, so be careful on mobile connections);
2. `yarn`
3. `npm start`

## Tests

... what?
