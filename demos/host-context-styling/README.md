# Theming custom elements with `:host-context()`

An example of how to theme Custom Elements via the `:host-context()` CSS selector.

As of March 2018, Custom Elements are supported by Chrome, Safari and Firefox, and ["under consideration"](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/status/customelements/) for Edge.

## What is this all about?

It's a demo for my [talk about CSS theming](https://github.com/MaxArt2501/css-theming-talk) for the Italian CSS Day in March 2018.
